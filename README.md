# CSCI559 Assignment03 - When Pigs Fly

In this assignment you will start with the github classroom link, create your own assignment repository, clone it on to your computer, make modifications to the unity project, commit the changes, and push back the updated repository to github.

## Potential Resources:

## Learning Outcomes
- In this project, you will learn about using the Virtual Reality Toolkit.
- Become familiar with VRTK simulator.
- Learn how to import 3D models that are not part of Unity (i.e. cubes, spheres, cylinders, ...).

## Directions
In order to receive full credit for the assignment you must do at minimum the steps outlined below, you may do more and explore other features within Unity and VRTK, in fact you are encouraged to do so as it will better prepare you for the two projects coming up in the second half of the semester.

### Required Steps
1. Watch VRTK YouTube Video [Using the VR Simulator Prefab](https://youtu.be/bxxGaJg75g4?list=PLTiD-q2AfVNJYGRdR9veojuO0t4v4idmI)
2. Accept github classroom assignment via link provided in email or on slack.
3. On a local resource clone the newly created repository.
4. Modify Unity project.
	- Import VRTK from the **Unity Asset Store**, you may need to do an *API Update Required* depending on the version of Unity you are using.
	- Deploy VRTK simulator (look at examples included in VRTK package).
	- Import a free model(s) from **Unity Asset Store** [^*] and add it(them) to your scene.
5. Explore your new scene from within the VRTK simulator.
6. Commit changes to repository, remember to add a useful commit message(s).
7. Push committed changes to github.

[^*]: You can import any model from any where as long as its more complicated than the cube, sphere, cylinder we have been using so far.  You can even create your own model if you like, but remember depending on where you get the model the quality might vary.
